/**
 * Recalls in words anyone can follow.
 *
 * NHTSA's notices are written for lawyers ("Gulf States Toyota, Inc. (GST)
 * is recalling certain 2017 Toyota Highlander … The fasteners for the roof
 * rails may not be torqued properly."). Each one becomes a headline of what
 * can go wrong, what's wrong, what could happen and the fix.
 *
 * When the owner turns it on (RECALL_SUMMARIES=on, and the same
 * ANTHROPIC_API_KEY Ask Sabicars uses), Claude rewrites the notice. What it is given is NHTSA's public text and the make,
 * nothing about the car or the visitor; its answer is checked (lengths,
 * sentences, no "free") and kept for 30 days per campaign. Switched off, or
 * when the answer is late, refused or out of bounds, the page gets NHTSA's
 * own sentences, trimmed of the opening "X is recalling…" sentence, phone
 * numbers, dates and letters to owners. Each recall says which it is, and the
 * badges ("Don't drive it", "Park it outside") always come from NHTSA's flags,
 * never from AI.
 *
 * Nothing here says a repair is free. A recall is repaired free at the maker's
 * dealers in the United States; that promise does not reach a car in Nigeria,
 * so "free of charge" is taken out of the fix, and an AI answer that says
 * "free" is not used. NHTSA's whole notice, unchanged, is still one tap away.

Use only facts that are in the notice. Add no advice, causes, numbers or reassurance that the notice doesn't give.
Replace technical words with everyday ones: "torqued" becomes "tightened", "ECM" becomes "engine computer".
Don't name the company that filed the recall. If the faulty part came from another company, say so without naming it, for example "a replacement windscreen made by another company".
Never say the fix is free or costs nothing, even if the notice does: the free repair is for owners in the United States only.
Don't use exclamation marks.
