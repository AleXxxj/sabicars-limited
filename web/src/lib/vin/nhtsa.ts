/**
 * Free United States government data about a vehicle, from NHTSA (the US road
 * safety agency).
 *
 * It knows cars first sold in America, which is most of the tokunbo SUVs and
 * saloons in Lagos. It does not know a car built for another market: a Toyota
 * Hiace bus decodes to nothing, and the page has to say so in plain words
 * (lib/actions/vin-check.ts), never show an empty answer as a clean one.
 *
 * Four sources, none needing a key or an account:
 *   - vPIC decodes a VIN into year, make, model, trim, body and engine;
 *   - Recalls lists the recalls issued for a year, make and model;
 *   - Complaints lists owners' reports for that model;
 *   - Safety Ratings gives the 5-Star crash-test results.
 *
 * Server-side only, so every call is checked, cached and rate-limited here
 * rather than sent from visitors' browsers.
 *
 * What is cached is the small summary this module builds, not NHTSA's raw
 * responses. A popular model's complaints arrive as one unpaged response of
 * 2 MB or more (the 2003 Accord: 2,013 complaints, 2.0 MB, 6.7 seconds,
 * measured Nov 2026), and Next's fetch cache refuses anything over 2 MB, so
 * caching the download would mean fetching it again on every check. A lookup
 * that fails is never cached: a timeout today must not hide the data for a
 * week.
 *
 * A cached answer past its refresh time is still shown once while a new one
 * is fetched in the background, so every answer carries the time NHTSA was
 * asked, and the page says "as of" that time rather than implying today.
 *
 * What this cannot say, and the page must not imply, is whether a recall
 * is still open on one specific car. NHTSA's VIN-level lookup sits behind a
 * CAPTCHA its terms forbid automating, and its API is "not meant to be used
 * ... to perform bulk VIN lookups". So recalls here are for the model, said
 * so plainly, with a link for the visitor to check their own VIN themselves.
 *
 * A VIN appears in no URL and no log line. The decode is a POST with the VIN
 * in the body, its cache entry is filed under a keyed hash of the VIN, and
 * errors name the lookup that failed, never the request.
