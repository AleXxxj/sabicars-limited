/**
 * The car check in words a buyer understands.
 *
 * Runs the real modules against real NHTSA and Wikimedia replies saved in
 * scripts/fixtures/vin (a 2017 Toyota Highlander, Nov 2026, the car the
 * developer tried, its VIN removed):
 *   - the facts and safety equipment read from the VIN decode;
 *   - the three recalls in NHTSA's own words, trimmed, as shown without AI;
 *   - the limits an AI summary must keep, and how AI answers that come back
 *     in time are merged with NHTSA's words for the ones that don't;
 *   - the choice of a Commons photo, and the requests that find it;
 *   - the crash-test versions compared, and the rollover chance.
 *
 * Written for buyers in Nigeria: petrol, tyres, a reverse camera, the country
 * a car was built in, and never "free of charge" (the free repair is for
 * owners in America).
 *
 * No request leaves this machine and no database is used: fetch and Claude
 * are replaced.
 *
 * Run: npm run test:vin
